### Analysis

The flag for this challenge is split into three parts, hidden in different areas of a simple website. This requires thorough inspection using browser developer tools.

1.  **Part 1 (HTML Source):** The first part is found inside an HTML comment. By right-clicking and selecting "View Page Source" or using the "Elements" tab in developer tools, a comment containing the first part of the flag is visible.

2.  **Part 2 (robots.txt):** The second part is found by navigating to the `/robots.txt` file. This is a standard file used to give instructions to web crawlers and is a common hiding spot for CTF clues.

3.  **Part 3 (Cookies):** The final part is hidden in a browser cookie. By opening the developer tools and navigating to the "Application" (Chrome) or "Storage" (Firefox) tab, the cookies for the site can be inspected. A cookie named `user_session` contains a Base64 encoded string.

4.  Decoding this value using a tool like CyberChef reveals the third and final part of the flag.
