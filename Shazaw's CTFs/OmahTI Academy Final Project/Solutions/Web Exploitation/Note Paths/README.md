# Solution: Note Paths

**Category:** Web Exploitation
**Points:** 500

### Analysis

The challenge is a simple note-taking website. The vulnerability is a logical flaw in the navigation.

1.  By clicking the "Next" and "Previous" buttons, the user can cycle through several notes. Observing the URL shows that the paths are `/note/1`, `/note/2`, `/note/4`, and `/note/5`.

2.  The key observation is that the path `/note/3` is conspicuously skipped in the navigation sequence.

3.  There are no security checks to prevent direct access to this path. By manually editing the URL in the browser to `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>/note/3`, the user can access the hidden note.

4.  This hidden note contains the flag.
