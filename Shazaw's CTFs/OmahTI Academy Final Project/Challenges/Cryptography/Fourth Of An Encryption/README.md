# Fourth of an Encryption

**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 1000

---
I've been really into Cryptography lately, and I've been researching about AES encryption. There's a lot of types of it, and I particularly like 192. I've encrypted a message with only a fourth of the rounds that 192 usually has. I hope you guys can find it!
