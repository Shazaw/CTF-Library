### Analysis

The challenge is a "Network Diagnostic Tool" that pings an IP address. This is a classic setup for a command injection vulnerability.

1.  The application takes user input and likely concatenates it into a shell command. This can be exploited by using a command separator like `;` to append new commands.

2.  A discovery command like `127.0.0.1; find / -name "*flag*"` can be used to search the filesystem for a file containing "flag" in its name, revealing its location.

3.  With the file path known, a second payload like `127.0.0.1; cat /path/to/flag.txt` is sent to read the file's contents.

4.  The server's response includes the output of the `cat` command, which is the flag.
