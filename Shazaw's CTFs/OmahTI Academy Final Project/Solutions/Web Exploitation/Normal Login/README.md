### Analysis

The challenge is a corporate login page that is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

1.  The goal is to bypass the authentication mechanism. This can be achieved by injecting SQL code into the username field.

2.  A classic and effective payload is `' OR '1'='1`. When this is entered as the username, the backend SQL query is manipulated.

3.  The query becomes something like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '...'`. Because the `OR '1'='1'` condition is always true, the query returns the first user from the database, which is typically the `admin`.

4.  The application logs the user in as the admin, and the flag is displayed on the admin's profile page.
